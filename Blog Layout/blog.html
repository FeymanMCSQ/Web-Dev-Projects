        With Marvel’s Spider-Man 2, Insomniac has the unenviable task of
        following up two riveting superhero fantasies full of excitement and
        heart. While that may sound like a good problem to have, the question
        becomes where do you go from there? Well, its answer is to double down.
        Double down on Spider-Men. Double down on the size of the map. Double
        down on explosive action sequences. In doing so, the studio has crafted
        another consistently exciting rollercoaster ride and the best story of
        the series yet – but stand the original alongside this sequel in other
        ways, and it can look a bit like two Spider-Man games pointing at each
        other. The excellent combat hasn’t gotten old, but it is largely the
        same fun as before, and despite that larger map, most of the open-world
        activities found within it are in desperate need of evolution. The
        result is a blockbuster in the most modern sense of the word: undeniably
        thrilling for long stretches, but by the numbers for others.

        Overall, there’s slightly less emphasis on stealth encounters this time
        than in either Spider-Man or Miles Morales. As someone who found the
        stealth action of the previous games a little simplistic and routine,
        this new, louder approach is welcome. Naturally, there are story
        missions where Miles or Peter have to slink across ceilings and take out
        thugs who never look up, but Spider-Man 2 is much more eager for you to
        get into the action, with many abilities designed to let you group up
        enemies and then deal big damage to all of them at once, rather than
        spreading them out to pick them off one by one.

        A new personal favourite gadget called the Web Grabber – which pulls
        enemies in from a distance and makes them smack into one another – also
        playfully builds into this philosophy. I had a lot of fun using this
        before landing a sharp burst of Miles’ Venom lightning onto grouped-up
        goons, and now Peter can get in on that fun as well. It takes a bit
        longer than I expected to arrive, but once Parker dons the symbiote suit
        already shown off in trailers, the gooey, angry powers that come with it
        make a big impact, adding more of a brawler nature to fights and giving
        Peter a set of tools to match Miles’ satisfying electric abilities.
        They’re just as enjoyable, as it feels like the suit is trying to burst
        out of the rumbling DualSense controller in my hands. This aggressive
        style of play is rewarded, as the only way to heal is by building up
        your focus bar – filled by landing hits and timing perfect dodges – and
        is another way to make sure that exciting rhythm of combat is never
        lost.
